# Coverage

This dataset is derived from selected public Certificate Transparency logs.

It is not intended to be exhaustive across all CT logs globally.

Log selection criteria:

- Stability
- Operational reliability
- Long-term maintenance commitment
- Broad certificate coverage

The focus is on:

- Deterministic ingestion
- Consistent structure
- Reliable daily publication

Rather than maximum theoretical coverage.

Log list is fixed per schema version.
Changes are versioned explicitly.
